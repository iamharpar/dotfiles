# Jason Lengstorf’s Dotfiles

This is the configuration I use for my development laptop (a MacBook Pro). It’s a combination of borrowed config, settings, and miscellaneous setup stuff that I use all the time.

## What’s in here?

* Shortcut aliases to do things that I otherwise have to Google constantly
* Git utilities to make my life easier
* Node utilities
* VS Code settings and aliases to use them

The files are commented pretty thoroughly, so poke your head into the `.bash_profile` to see what’s happening.
